## What I have done

I've created a method saveGameResults(line 49) that records the winner of the game and saves the result in the file "gameResults.txt". The method is called in the main method after the game is over.  

I've also created a method checkFileExistence(line 39) that checks if the file "gameResults.txt" exists. If it doesn't exist, the method creates the file. The method is called in the main method before the game starts.
