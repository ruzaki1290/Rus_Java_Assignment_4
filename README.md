## What I have done

I've created a method saveGameResults that records the winner of the game and saves the result in the file "gameResults.txt". The method is called in the main method after the game is over. It can be found in the IO.java file, just bellow the saveGame method that we did in class.

I've also created a method checkFileExistence(line 39) that checks if the file "gameResults.txt" exists. If it doesn't exist, the method creates the file. The method is called in the main method before the game starts.
